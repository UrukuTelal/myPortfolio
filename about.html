        </div>


        <p>
            Hello, <br><br>
            &nbsp My name is Andrew, but I go by Drew. <br><br>In multiplayer games I'm B334, send a shout if you see
            me.
            üòé<br><br>
            &nbsp I'm a lifelong learner, gamer, coder, and space nerd. I'm also a father of one, and your basic
            hedonistic rat-bastard. üòÖ My favorite place is Pismo Beach, and I'm a terrible surfer.<br><br>
            &nbsp I studied Computer Science at Fresno Community College, and Game Development at Devry University
            focusing on C++, but I started coding basic when I was nine, and I maintained some websites in high
            school during the nineties as a side-gig.

            <p id="depressing" style="display: none;">
                <button class="button" onclick="toggleVerified()">Are you sure?</button>
            </p>
        </center>


        <p id="verified" style="display: none;">
            When my father died of cancer, I took a break from school to take care of my ailing mother, who made
            it about a year before she also passed. In that same year, I found out I was T1 Diabetic, after
            I woke up from a DKA coma. Suffice to say, my life went on hold for a number of years as I came to
            grips with being an orphan and dealing with a disease I knew almost nothing about.
            <br>
            <br>
            But don't pity me, I'm not looking for sympathy, just giving some reference to why at 43 years old I
            have no professional coding experience.

            showDepressing = !showDepressing;
            document.getElementById('depressing').style.display = showDepressing ? 'block' : 'none';
            // Hide the verified text when the depressing button is toggled
            document.getElementById('verified').style.display = 'none';
        }

        let showVerified = false;

        function toggleVerified() {
            showVerified = !showVerified;
            document.getElementById('verified').style.display = showVerified ? 'block' : 'none';
        }
    </script>

            &nbsp However, I resumed my studies, albeit outside of school, and I went back to my web development and
            picked up HTML 5, (it was 4, back in the '90s üòâ), Javascript, and React. Now I'm working on adding
            Python, and Django to my repertoire, and am developing an Android app to export history data from the
            FreeStyle Libra apps to help T1 Diabetics, whom use the FreeStyle CGMs to monitor their glucose levels,
            have an easy way to communicate that history with their doctors and support team. <br><br>
            &nbsp I'm also working on developing a voxel based space game similar to avorion, but with significant
            differences, for instance I want player made ships to be able to land on fully destructable voxel
            planets, moons and asteroids. They will also be able to make bases, mines, and space constructs, upto
            megastucture scales, like orbital rings and even dyson spheres. (but, this game will probably take me a
            few years to get to even a fraction of want I want to do with it. üòè)
